# opencv_face_detection
face dataset, training, recognition

This is my portfolio.
It's a real-time face recognition project using raspberry pi.

The order is as follows
First, recognize people's faces.
Second, let the data learn about the face.
Third, check if the face exists in the learned data. If it does not exist, notify it as an unregistered user (unknown) and print the name if it does exist.
